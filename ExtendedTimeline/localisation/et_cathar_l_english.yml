 et_cathar.EVTNAME1:0 "Emergence of Catharism"
 et_cathar.EVTDESC1:0 "A recently emerged Christian movement known as Catharism has been gaining followers among the common folk in some of our provinces. The followers calling themselves Good Christians believe in a dualistic world with two divine beings, God the creator and satan the destroyer. Many Christians see this as antithetical to their monotheistic beliefs and the established Christian churches have denounced Catharism as heretical. The spread of this new religion could pose a threat on Papal authority in Europe if left unchecked."

 et_cathar.EVTNAME2:0 "Spread of Catharism"
 et_cathar.EVTDESC2:0 "Catharism is slowly spreading in Western Europe through its followers.

 et_cathar.EVTNAME3:0 "Question of Reform"
 et_cathar.EVTDESC3:0 "While Catharism holds the key to many truths, some of its more extreme beliefs may not be practical to enforce over all of society.

Our secular advisors instruct us to reform the religion to tone down some of its more extreme beliefs."
 et_cathar.3.a:0 "Implement the reforms."
 et_cathar.3.b:0 "We shall not stray from the true faith."
 et_cathar.EVTNAME4:0 "Albigensian Crusade"
 et_cathar.EVTDESC4:0 "The heretical movement Catharism is spreading uncontrolled and converting many Christians to their ranks. The Pope as the head of Catholicism, the true faith, has to find the means to stop this heresy from spreading further. A crusade where all loyal Catholic rulers join together to defeat the Cathars could be an effective solution."
 et_cathar.4.a:0 "Call for a crusade!"
 et_cathar.4.b:0 "We should be more cautious."
 et_cathar.EVTNAME5:0 "Albigensian Crusade"
 et_cathar.EVTDESC5:0 "The Pope has declared a crusade against the Cathars and requested all Catholic rulers to take part in eliminating any Cathar minorities in their borders and taking war to countries who protect them. Now it is up to us to decide if we want to take part in protecting the integrity of the Catholic faith."
 et_cathar.5.a:0 "Support the crusade."
 et_cathar.5.b:0 "It's not our business."
